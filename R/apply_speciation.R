#' Resolve cladogenetic and anagetic speciation in the island community
#'
#' Scan the island community and if conditions for cladogenetic speciation are
#' met, splits species accordingly. Then does the same for anagenetic speciation.
#'
#' @details **For cladogenesis**:
#' For each species, check if there is any gap `>= trait_dist_sp` in trait
#' values, and split the relevant species in two when one is found. The less
#' numerous half becomes the new species.
#'
#' **For anagenesis**:
#' Only concerns non-endemic species, i.e. species that are still the same as
#' one of the populations in `mainland_comm`. Such a species becomes a new
#' species if the *average* trait value of its members differs from the average
#' trait value of the mainland population by `trait_dist_sp`.
#'
#' @inheritParams default_params_doc
#' @note `apply_speciation()` can currently only split one species into two. If
#' multiple gaps emerge in a species at a single time step, only the first one
#' will be treated. As long as branching does not happen at every generation,
#' this is unlikely to be an issue, because an unresolved gap will be caught on
#' the next time step. In phylogenetic terms, this results in polytomies being
#' resolved as soft polytomies.
#' Besides, simultaneous branching events in different species are handled
#' perfectly fine.
